Firefox Takeout - Take your firefox data with you! 

This tool offers a simple yet extremely useful functionality that allows users to take
their firefox browsing data with them to other systems. Its easy to use. Just run the 
jar file. You will then have options to takeout your data or bring in data that you 
previously took out. The takeout feature will then make a folder named FirefoxTakeout
on your Desktop that contains the data. You can then transfer the folder manually to 
other locations where you want to bring in the data. To bring in, all you need to do 
is to place the folder that you took out on the desktop and run the bring in functionality
from the tool.
